# sudoku solver

This is a sudoku solver that uses similar processes that a human would, to solve a sudoku.
Checks each row, column, and 9 square to see if there is only 1 possible option for the space.
Keeps checking and deleting all possibilities from each space until it can't anymore. 
Can usually solve most easy and medium sudoku puzzles, but harder puzzles would require other methods.
